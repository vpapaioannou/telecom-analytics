User Profiling
==============

The user is profiled starting from the CDR building a matrix representing the its call behaviour.

Each user is profiled in each area (i.e. covered by several towers). For example in different area of the city.

The following query implement the process in SQL.

Parameters: 
Antenna_areas table (tower_id, area_id)
The time partitioning (i.e 0-8, 8-19, 19-24)
The period (i.e. week>=8 and week<=12)

User Profiling

    create table user_profiles as
    select user_id, area_id, week, weekday, time_slot, count(distinct(week,weekday,_day)) as count
        From
            (
            SELECT distinct user_id, area_id, extract (week from ts) as week, 
            case when extract (isodow from ts) <6 then '0'::integer else '1'::integer end as weekday , 
            case when ts::time between timestamp '2012-01-01 00:00:00'::time and  timestamp '2012-01-01 07:59:59'::time then '1'::integer
            when ts::time between timestamp '2012-01-01 08:00:00'::time and  timestamp '2012-01-01 18:59:59'::time then '2'::integer
            when ts::time between timestamp '2012-01-01 19:00:00'::time and  timestamp '2012-01-01 23:59:59'::time then '3'::integer
            end as time_slot,
            date_trunc('day',ts) as _day, ts
            FROM cdr_data s, antenne_areas g
                    where substr(s.antenna_id,1,5)=g.tower_id and week >= 8 and week <= 12
            ) as a
        group by 1,2,3,4,5
        order by user_id, week, weekday, time_slot;
